# Long_Form_Summarization_using_python
Here i Describe all the process of this project.
first we install all required library which help us in summarization
libraries like pandas , matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, beautifulsoup, transformers,
here little description for these libraies 
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
matplotlib is best or 2d data visualization 
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical
NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. Interoperable
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping
Each Transformers architecture is defined in a standalone Python module so they can be easily customized for research and experiments
Here we Summarize Long text by using Huggingface Transformation in python through web scraping.
Here we also use Pyttsx3 for speaking the summarize text
